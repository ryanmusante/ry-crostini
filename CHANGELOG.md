ry-crostini changelog

2026-04-07  Ryan Musante

- Tagged as v8.1.0
- feat(MAJOR): bookworm is now the primary target. The default flow stays on the current codename (no `bookworm`→`trixie` rewrite, no mandatory container restart). Trixie upgrade is opt-in via `--upgrade-trixie`. Already-on-trixie containers are unaffected — the script detects the codename and runs the existing trixie path. Bookworm-on-arrival is the documented Crostini default in 2026.
- feat(HIGH): step 2 enables `bookworm-backports` automatically when running on bookworm. Step 6 then refreshes `pipewire-audio` + `wireplumber` from backports (1.4.2 / 0.5.8) so the WirePlumber 0.5+ JSON `.conf` written by step 6 is honored. Without this, bookworm's stock wireplumber 0.4.13 (Lua-only) silently ignores the gaming-tuning config.
- feat(HIGH): step 3 adds `p7zip-full` on bookworm to provide the `7z` command. Bookworm's `7zip` package only ships `7zz`; the existing verification check for `7z` would otherwise fail.
- feat(HIGH): step 8 adds `adwaita-icon-theme-full` on bookworm. Bookworm's `adwaita-icon-theme` 43-1 does not include the full set; trixie's 45.0-4+ does and the package is unnecessary there.
- feat(HIGH): step 10 falls back to vanilla `dosbox` 0.74 on bookworm (`dosbox-x` is not in bookworm main or backports). The DOSBox-X config heredoc is skipped on bookworm since the format is incompatible. The earlyoom `--prefer` regex is templated and uses `dosbox` on bookworm, `dosbox-x` on trixie. The dosbox version probe in step 10 verification is dispatched to the right binary name.
- feat(HIGH): step 10 skips `box64` on bookworm with an informational log instead of a noisy WARN (`box64` is not in any Debian repo). `run-x86` already falls back to `qemu-user`. The `.box64rc` heredoc is skipped on bookworm.
- feat(MED): step 2 cros-package hold gating is now bookworm-aware. `cros-guest-tools` is unheld with the rest on bookworm (cros-im is available there); the permanent hold remains for trixie.
- feat(MED): step 2d `/tmp` tmpfs cap is skipped on bookworm. Bookworm's `/tmp` is disk-backed; the cap is only meaningful on trixie's tmpfs `/tmp`.
- feat(MED): step 11 verification adapts to the codename: tool-presence checks for `dosbox` vs `dosbox-x`, drops `box64` on bookworm, and skips the `tmp.mount` / `dosbox-x.conf` / `.box64rc` config-file checks on bookworm.
- feat(LOW): new `IS_BOOKWORM` global is set at script init (after argument parsing, before any `should_run_step` gate) so resume runs (`--from-step=N`, `--verify`) and standalone verify runs see the same value as fresh runs. Detection is gated on `! $UPGRADE_TRIXIE` so bookworm-with-upgrade-flag still applies trixie-targeted behavior in step 2 (cros hold, `/tmp` cap) before the rewrite.
- feat(LOW): step 2 hard-stop is now driven by `_did_trixie_rewrite`, set true only inside the actual rewrite branch. Previously the original v8.0.9 hard-stopped unconditionally even on already-trixie containers; v8.1.0 hard-stops only when sources were genuinely rewritten (i.e., the libc6/dbus/systemd swap actually happened).
- doc: header comments, `usage()` text, and step 2 banner reframed bookworm-primary. `--skip-trixie` is accepted as a backward-compat alias for the new default behavior.
- compat: trixie path is preserved bit-for-bit. All bookworm gates fall through to original trixie behavior when `IS_BOOKWORM=false`. Verified across four scenarios: bookworm default, bookworm + `--upgrade-trixie`, trixie default, trixie + `--upgrade-trixie` (no-op).

- Tagged as v8.0.9
- fix(HIGH): step 2 now hard-exits after the Trixie dist-upgrade instead of emitting a soft WARN. Root cause of the v8.0.8 +14m03s SIGTERM (exit 143) during step 11 verification: dpkg replaces libc6/dbus/systemd mid-run, and any subsequent long-lived interaction with stale processes (dbus, sommelier, session manager) can trip the container into killing the script. The v8.0.7 recommendation was advisory and ignorable; v8.0.9 saves the checkpoint, prints the required action, and exits 0. Re-running resumes cleanly at step 3.
- fix(LOW): step 10 now probes `apt-cache policy unrar` before attempting install. Trixie moves unrar to `non-free-non-free`; the previous unconditional attempt exited 100 and produced a noisy `Command exited 100` WARN in every log. The probe is silent when no candidate exists and the script falls through to `unar` as before.
- chore(LOW): `_tee_log` now filters three anchored upstream-benign noise patterns before logging — (a) dpkg `unable to delete old directory '/…': Directory not empty` (Trixie usrmerge residue), (b) `…: Failed to write 'change' to '/sys/…/uevent': Permission denied` (udisks2 postinst `udevadm trigger` against read-only Crostini /sys), (c) `systemctl: error while loading shared libraries: libcrypto.so.3: …` (transient libssl3 → libssl3t64 t64 ABI transition). Patterns are line-anchored and will not match unrelated dpkg warnings or other systemctl errors.

- Tagged as v8.0.8
- fix(HIGH): sudo keepalive no longer kills the script mid-`apt-get full-upgrade`. Root cause of the +4m20s (v8.0.6) and +8m53s (v8.0.7) SIGTERMs: during the Trixie dist-upgrade, dpkg replaces sudo + libpam-modules + libpam-modules-bin + libpam-runtime + libpam-systemd, and `sudo -n -v` legitimately fails for a stretch in the middle. The 3-strike (~3 min) tolerance tripped and the keepalive sent SIGTERM to the very apt operation it was supposed to protect. Now: (a) failures are not counted while `/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend` is held — the foreground apt already has its credentials; (b) threshold raised from 3 to 15 (~15 min) so the safety net only fires when sudo is genuinely dead.

2026-04-07  Ryan Musante

- Tagged as v8.0.7
- fix(HIGH): step 2 dropped the redundant `apt-get upgrade` that preceded `apt-get full-upgrade`. On a bookworm→trixie codename transition `upgrade` keeps back ~160 packages because it cannot add/remove, so the work was redone seconds later by `full-upgrade`. The wasted ~4 min of duplicate dpkg activity caused the in-container wall-clock SIGTERM observed at +4m20s.
- fix(MED): step 2 now emits a prominent WARN at completion recommending `Shut down Linux` from the ChromeOS shelf before resuming. Trixie dist-upgrade replaces libc6/dbus/systemd under the running container (dpkg itself prints `A reboot is required to replace the running dbus-daemon`); subsequent steps in the same session can interact with stale long-running processes.

2026-04-07  Ryan Musante

- Tagged as v8.0.6
- fix(LOW): cleanup() now prints the correct "Verification failed — run --verify" message when an exit occurs inside step 11 or 12. `_had_failures` is snapshotted from `$_verify_fail` at the end of each verification step instead of only at step 13, closing a window where the trap saw `_had_failures=0` despite non-zero `_verify_fail` and fell through to the generic "resume from checkpoint" path.
- fix(LOW): bare `--force` (without `--reset`) now emits a warning instead of being silently consumed as a no-op. Catches typos like `--forced` collapsing to `--force`.
- cleanup(LOW): step 11's `$HOME/.local/bin` PATH injection moved inside the `should_run_step 11` guard. Previously ran unconditionally on every invocation including `--from-step=1..10` where it was wasted work.

2026-04-06  Ryan Musante

- Tagged as v8.0.5
- fix(MED): step 2a no longer hard-die()s on missing /etc/apt/sources.list. cp/sed gated on `[[ -f ]]`; deb822-only containers are handled by the *.sources loop.
- fix(LOW): version-marker self-heal greps switched to `grep -Fq` — `${SCRIPT_VERSION}` dots no longer interpreted as regex (5 user sites + earlyoom).
- fix(LOW): /etc/default/earlyoom gains `# ry-crostini:@@VERSION@@` marker, sed-substituted at write time. Self-heals on version bump instead of relying on a bare `'ry-crostini'` literal.
- fix(LOW): _LOCK_ACQUIRED set immediately after successful mkdir, before PID-file write. Closes the window where a signal would orphan the lock dir.
- fix(LOW): step 1o reuses cached AVAIL_MB from step 1e — one df invocation per step 1.
- doc(INFO): SC2031 disable annotations on the 4 main-shell sites tainted by the legitimate subshell at line 571.
- cleanup: dropped redundant `chmod 600` after mktemp in `_strip_log_ansi` (mktemp creates 0600).

2026-04-06  Ryan Musante

- Tagged as v8.0.4
- fix(HIGH): EARLYOOM_ARGS dropped literal single quotes around --prefer/--avoid regexes — systemd EnvironmentFile preserves inner quotes verbatim, so earlyoom regcomp'd "'(retroarch|...)'" and never matched. Prefer/avoid tuning was silently no-op since v7.9.8.
- fix(MED): step 13 sources ~/.config/environment.d/*.conf into the script shell before `systemctl --user import-environment` so MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE / GSK_RENDERER / QT_QPA_PLATFORM are actually imported (no-args import-environment captures the calling shell's env, not environment.d files).
- fix(MED): apt 90parallel comment now matches behaviour ("retries + skip translations + per-scheme queue") — Pipeline-Depth=0 disables pipelining and Queue-Mode=access serializes per scheme; the "parallel/pipelining" claim was wrong.
- fix(MED): step 1d die()s on missing/empty VERSION_CODENAME instead of silently defaulting to "bookworm" — step 2a already aborted on the same condition; preflight is the right place to fail.
- fix(LOW): tmp.mount drop-in restores upstream `strictatime` and `nr_inodes=1m` (drop-in replaces Options entirely; the v8.0.0 cap was dropping these).
- fix(LOW): step 11 splits Qt5 verification into two distinct dpkg -s checks (qt5-gtk-platformtheme, adwaita-qt) — previous OR-fallback logged "Qt5 GTK platform theme ✓" when only adwaita-qt was installed.
- fix(LOW): self-healing version-marker idempotency on the 5 user files with `# ry-crostini:VERSION` markers (gpu.conf, pipewire gaming, pipewire-pulse gaming, wireplumber alsa, fontconfig fonts.conf). Upgraded users now receive content updates instead of stale 8.0.2 configs forever.
- fix(LOW): version markers in those 5 heredocs use `@@VERSION@@` placeholder, sed-substituted at write time (parity with run-x86 / gog-extract / run-game wrappers).
- fix(LOW): added a pre-scan loop for --help / --version that runs before LOG_FILE is touched; main arg-parse loop runs after touch+chmod 600 so any die() in arg-parse still gets a properly-mode-600 log file. --version now works in read-only $HOME and neither --help nor --version leave a stray log file behind.
- fix(LOW): run-game big-core detection accepts standard ARM Cortex-A76 (part 0xd0b) in addition to Qualcomm Kryo Gold (0x804), enabling affinity on RPi5 and other generic A76 hosts.
- doc(INFO): shellcheck SC2031 disable comments suppress 3 false positives where LOG_FILE is referenced from main shell after the legitimate subshell taint at line 571.

- Tagged as v8.0.3
- fix(HIGH): sudo keepalive aborts loudly after 3 consecutive failures instead of silently spinning forever after credential expiry (was masking 30s apt-get sudo timeouts in main loop).
- fix(MED): write_file_sudo refuses to write through a symlink — `sudo test ! -L "$tmp"` guard between mktemp and tee (parity with ry-install).
- fix(MED): _write_file_impl gets the same symlink guard for $HOME writes.
- fix(MED): --reset now prompts for confirmation before deleting checkpoint+log; require --force in non-interactive mode.
- fix(MED): Trixie network probe gains `--retry 2 --retry-delay 1` (was single attempt, no retry, no fallback).
- fix(MED): remove redundant global `export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive`; already re-exported per sudo callsite (sudo strips it via env_reset).
- fix(LOW): _handle_signal exits 128+N per POSIX (HUP=129, INT=130, QUIT=131, PIPE=141, TERM=143) instead of generic exit 1.
- fix(LOW): cleanup re-raise gains explicit signal allowlist (defence-in-depth against $_received_signal clobber).
- refactor(LOW): extract _read_os_release helper; consolidates 6 duplicate `. /etc/os-release` call sites.
- doc(LOW): clarifying comment on `set +e` in cleanup (safe — final code path before exit).
- doc(LOW): clarifying comment on subshell-local LOG_FILE in _parallel_check_tools (SC2030/2031 — not a clobber).
